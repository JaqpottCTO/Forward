## Key Features

1. **Level-Based Feature Unlocking:**
   - Each level unlocks new features as users progress through the app.

2. **User Engagement:**
   - Prompts users to describe their app and provides guidance on app development.

3. **Promotion and Selling:**
   - Offers insights into promoting and selling products or services through the app.

4. **Support Sessions:**
   - Provides access to Blerd University support sessions for additional help.

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- Follow Java best practices and coding standards.
- Use meaningful variable and method names.
- Keep methods short and focused on a single task.

### Architectural Pattern

- **Model:** Handles data sources (e.g., database, API).
- **ViewModel:** Contains business logic and communicates with the Model.
- **View:** Handles UI elements and updates based on ViewModel events.

### Dependencies

Add necessary dependencies in the `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel:2.2.0'
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0'
    // Other dependencies
}
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for ViewModel and business logic.
- Use instrumentation tests for UI components.
